# InstantTranslateUX-UI

The InstantTranslate AR glasses show promise in addressing the
challenge of real-time language translation in a user-friendly and
hands-free format. By integrating text and speech translation capa-
bilities into a single platform, our prototype demonstrated signif-
icant potential to connect communications for travelers and stu-
dents. Through validation and feedback, our project showcased
how AR technology can be leveraged to provide seamless interac-
tion in multilingual environments. Although the current prototype
effectively handles one-on-one dialogues and text translation, fu-
ture improvements can be made by enhancing system performance
in noisy and crowded environments and further refining the inter-
face based on user feedback. In conclusion, InstantTranslate repre-
sents a significant step forward in real-time translation technology
with the potential to empower users worldwide and redefine com-
munication in multicultural settings.
